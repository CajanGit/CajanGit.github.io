  <h1>California Roll Facts</h1>
  <u1>Known as a makizushi sushi roll by the Japanese, the California roll as we have come to know and love it as, is an inside-out sushi roll.<u1/>
  <u1> It has been said before, more than a few times on record, that a California Roll is not technically Sushi. Its authenticity has been called into question time and time again, with people claiming that due to its somewhat contemporary nature, it cannot be considered ‘authentic sushi’. This is in fact a myth. The term Sushi is used when talking about any short-grained rice that is seasoned using vinegar or as is more commonly used nowadays, a small amount of salt and a small amount of sugar. It does not matter how big it is or what is its shape, if this type of seasoned rice is used to make it then technically, it is sushi. -https://www.sushicounter.com/blog/myths-facts-california-rolls-sushi<u1/>
